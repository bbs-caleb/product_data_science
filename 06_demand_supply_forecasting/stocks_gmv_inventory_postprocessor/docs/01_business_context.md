# 01. Business Context

## Why this exists
In retail/FMCG planning, sales are often **censored by availability**:
- Demand may be high, but sales stop once a SKU hits zero stock (OOS).
- If we evaluate the model on sales only, we punish it for supply issues.

## What the business needs (and who asks)
- Head of Planning: "Is the plan feasible? Where are we losing money because of OOS? Is the forecast actually getting worse?"
- Commercial/Marketing: "Can we run a promo without breaking availability? Which SKUs should be substituted?"
- Supply/Logistics: "Which SKUs should be expedited or redistributed? Where are the top losses?"

## Problem statement in one line
Convert a demand forecast into a **governed, executable plan**, separating:
- model error
- and supply constraints,
and turning both into **actions**.
